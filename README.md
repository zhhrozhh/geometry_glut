<per>
geo2d.h provide basic 2d geometry elements: point, line, angle, line ,line segement, n-gon, circle.
and some structures like point-line system(PLSystem/LPSystem), line-line system... and related operations about them.

RFunction.h provode multiple variable real function class and related operations(derivative, integral)

geo2d and RFunction can cooperate with opgl for graph
