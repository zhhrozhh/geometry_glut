<per>
geo2d.h provide basic 2d geometry elements: point, line, angle, line ,line segement, n-gon, circle.
and some structures like point-line system(PLSystem/LPSystem), line-line system... and related operations about them.

RFunction.h provode multiple variable real function class and related operations(derivative, integral)

geo2d and RFunction can cooperate with opgl for graph

see demo for examples
still under testing, might be very unstable
